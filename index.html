		These two handsome dogs are Sam and Lola. They are both <a href="great_pyrenees.html">Great Pyrenees</a> mixes that weigh over 75 lbs. Sam and Lola have been a continual blessing in my life... at least once they got potty trained. They like to wrestle with each other and knock stuff over in my living room! There is never a dull moment with these two dogs in my house.

		In conclusion, my dogs are:
		<li>Large</li>
		<li>Entertaining</li>
		<li>Cute</li>
		Basically the best dogs in the world

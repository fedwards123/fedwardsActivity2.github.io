<h1>Great Pyrenees</h1>
	<section>
		<p>
		Great Pyrenees are big fluffy snowballs of dogs. They tend to be anywhere from 80lbs to 140lbs depending on the gender. They are naturally herding dogs that were originally bred to watch over flocks of sheep in the mountainous areas of France. The Great Pyrenees that were assigned this job were often left alone for days so the breed has a fierce streak of independence. This can make them difficult to train, but it also means that the dog is very intelligent.
